title: Fix saving boolean false filter
type: fix
description: |
  In the case of boolean fields with operator `false`,
  filter was transformed in order to check for null or false.
  But by doing that, original criteria was lost, breaking meta filter saving.
  Replaced client-side operators `true` and `false` by new virtual operators
  `$isTrue` and `$isFalse` which perform client-side transformation.
