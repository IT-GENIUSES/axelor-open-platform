title: Improve details-view usage
type: feature
description: |
  In a details-view, the form view can be closed on demand or if there is no selected 
  line. When we delete a line in the grid, the record in the form is no more displayed.
  
  This also fix duplicated requests, missing onLoad/onNew calls in some conditions and 
  reset attrs states on form view.
