title: Fix context of kanban in dashlet
type: fix
description: |
  Apply the same context behavior as other dashlets,
  ie. merge action-view context with current record context.

  Instead of domain, use criteria (as it is done for calendars) for the `columnBy` filter,
  as to avoid conflict with current record context.
