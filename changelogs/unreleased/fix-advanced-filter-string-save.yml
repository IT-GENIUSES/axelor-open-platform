title: Fix saving filter with string field
type: fix
description: |
  In the case of string fields with operators `isNull` and `notNull`,
  filter was transformed in order to check for null or empty.
  But by doing that, original criteria was lost, breaking meta filter saving.

  Instead, use new virtual operators `$isEmpty` and `$notEmpty`
  which perform client-side transformation.
