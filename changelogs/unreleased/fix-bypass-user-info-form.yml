title: Fix the view opened on mail thread creator link
type: fix
description: |
  The `user-info-form` view can be bypassed if we refresh the browser tab after 
  clicking on mail thread creator. The view is now opened in popup. If no view 
  is defined, nothing is opened (no more fallback on `user-form`).
