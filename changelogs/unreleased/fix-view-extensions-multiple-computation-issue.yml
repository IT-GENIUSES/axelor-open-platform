title: Run views loader tasks only once
type: change
description: |
  Introduce viewLoader `terminate` after loading all modules.
  
  Some tasks need to be run only once after all modules have been
  installed/loaded. These tasks are the missing group creation and
  generation of computed views.
  
  This will significantly improve the generation of computed views
  as it will be run once when all modules are loaded.
